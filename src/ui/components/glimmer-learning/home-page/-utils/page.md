# One week playing with Glimmerjs


## So what's up here ?

A seven days [Glimmerjs]() learning experience summarized in few components.

you can look at the code on [github]().

so i started playing with [glimer playground]().

but as i progress in discovering glimmerjs i feel limited by the playground cause i can't use helpers.

so i moved to my environment and started fresh new project.

i know that was difference between the playground and the distributed ember-cli version,
but hey we are here to learn and for now ember-cli is the best entry point so let's go!

> a pull request that allow helpers in playground has been submitted recently.
