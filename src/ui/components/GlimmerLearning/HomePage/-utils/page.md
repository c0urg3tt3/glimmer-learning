# One week playing with Glimmerjs


## So what's up here ?

A seven days [Glimmerjs](https://glimmerjs.com) learning experience summarized in few components.

you can look at the code on [github](https://github.com/c0urg3tt3/glimmer-learning).

so i started playing with [glimmer playground](http://try.glimmerjs.com).


> Edit: No more huge difference between the playground and the ember-cli experience as @glimmer/blueprint has been updated.


~~but as i progress in discovering glimmerjs i feel limited by the playground cause i can't use helpers.~~

~~so i moved to my environment and started fresh new project.~~

~~i know that was difference between the playground and the distributed ember-cli version,
but hey we are here to learn and for now ember-cli is the best entry point so let's go!~~
