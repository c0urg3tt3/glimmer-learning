# Update & Fix

Well this is the end of the last hours i have kept to update & fix the demo when glimmerjs will be updated ... here we are, some small change and every thing is working, sure not production ready, but that wasn't the purpose.


## conclusion

Thanks to Tom Dales that pointed out the glimmer-playground on twitter, that was the starting point of a nice week exploring source code and reading lot of issue / PR, can't wait for futur Emberjs version that will leverage all the promising Glimmerjs features.

For now some bugs are limiting exploration of the true power of Glimmerjs, but hopefully soon enougth that will be fixed and we will go again!

Hope you enjoyed the trip!
